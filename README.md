#### Spikeing Led Network

This code runs a spiking neural network in C that interpretes input from enviromental sensors to drive visual and audio outputs. Runs on a Beaglebone Black, and executes PRU code to interact with sensors and drive LED light displays. Originally based on basic code for the HCS04 as well as a branch from PixelBone as it split off from LEDScape, making it easy to use one PRU for sensing and one to drive the lights.

Hardware configuration:

	* TRIGGER		P8_12 gpio1[12] GPIO44	out	pulldown		Mode: 7 
	* ECHO			P8_11 gpio1[13] GPIO45	in	pulldown		Mode: 7 *** with R 1KOhm
	* GND			P9_1 or P9_2	GND
	* VCC			P9_5 or P9_6	VDD_5V
	* LED signal 0          P9_22 
	* 
	* Potentiometer power = P9_32; signal = P9_39; grd = P9_44; 

	
	Make sure there is a 1KOhm resistor between ECHO pin and your beaglebone
	as input pins are 3.3V while sensor emits 5V

### To build:
make
### To install driver:

	make install_spikinglednetwork.sh
	It will copy device tree driver to /lib/firmware and add it to the cape manager. Currently works for Pixelbone and 	HCSR04 communication. 

### Under construction:
